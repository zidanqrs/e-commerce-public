# E-Commerce-Public

This project is an interactive dashboard built using Streamlit. The dashboard uses the Brazilian E-Commerce Public Dataset by Olis as its data source. This dataset contains information about e-commerce transactions in Brazil and provides an overview of online buying trends and patterns in the country.

In this dashboard, an attractive and interactive data visualization is created. This visualization will help to understand various aspects of e-commerce sales in Brazil.

This project was done in order to participate in the MSIB program at Kampus Merdeka. The name of the activity that I participated in from the MSIB program is Bangkit Academy 2024 By Google, GoTo, Traveloka, which took the Machine Learning learning path. This Dashboard project is to complete the course organized through the dicoding platform, namely "Belajar Analisis Data dengan Python Course".
